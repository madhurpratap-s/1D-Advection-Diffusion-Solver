# 1-D Advection-Diffusion Equation Solver

This repository contains a Python implementation of a **1-D Advection-Diffusion equation solver** using the **Crank-Nicolson method**. The solver computes the numerical solution and compares it with the analytical solution obtained using the **Gaussian Mirror Method**.

## üìñ 1-D Advection-Diffusion Equation

The 1-D advection-diffusion equation is given by:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = D \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
\]

where:

- \( u(x,t) \) is the scalar quantity being transported,
- \( v \) is the advection velocity,
- \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient.

This equation describes the transport of a substance in a medium with both **advection** (transport due to bulk motion) and **diffusion** (spreading due to random motion).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Crank-Nicolson Method

The **Crank-Nicolson method** is an implicit finite difference scheme that is unconditionally stable, meaning the numerical solution won‚Äôt blow up. However, stability alone doesn‚Äôt guarantee a physically meaningful solution ‚Äî especially when advection is involved. This is addressed in the code through calculation of accuracy factors whose values can guide the user in defining the configuration file.  

The Crank-Nicolson method uses a time-centered difference to discretize the equation:

\[
\frac{u_i^{n+1} - u_i^n}{\Delta t} + v \frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - u_{i-1}^{n+1} + u_{i+1}^{n} - u_{i-1}^{n}}{4 \Delta x} = D \frac{u_{i+1}^{n+1} - 2u_i^{n+1} + u_{i-1}^{n+1} + u_{i+1}^{n} - 2u_i^{n} + u_{i-1}^{n}}{2 \Delta x^2}
\]

This leads to a **tridiagonal system of equations** that can be solved efficiently using the Thomas algorithm.

## üìä Analytical Solution Using the Gaussian Mirror Method

The **Gaussian Mirror Method** provides an analytical solution to the **1D Advection-Diffusion Equation** for a finite domain by considering mirrored image sources.

### üî¢ Mathematical Formulation

For an initial Gaussian pulse centered at \( x_0 \) with standard deviation \( \sigma \), the free-space solution for the advection-diffusion equation is:

\[
u(x,t) = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + 2Dt}} \exp\left( - \frac{(x - (x_0 + vt))^2}{2 (\sigma^2 + 2Dt)} \right)
\]

However, in a **finite domain** with **Dirichlet boundary conditions**, the **Gaussian Mirror Method** accounts for boundaries by summing over reflected images of the Gaussian pulse:

\[
u(x,t) = \sum_{n=-N}^{N} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{\sigma^2 + 2Dt}} \exp\left( - \frac{(x - (x_0 + vt) - 2nL)^2}{2 (\sigma^2 + 2Dt)} \right)
\]

where:

- \( L \) is the domain length,
- \( v \) is the advection velocity,
- \( D \) is the diffusion coefficient,
- \( n \) represents the mirrored reflections,
- \( N \) is the number of reflections considered.

As \( N \to \infty \), this summation enforces the correct boundary conditions while preserving the Gaussian profile's evolution.
